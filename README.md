# 2048 Game

## Project Overview
The 2048 Game is an classic puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the 2048 tile. This project is designed using an object-oriented approach, with the core functionality encapsulated within the Game class. This class efficiently manages the game state, including grid updates and game logic, ensuring transitions between different states: «idle», «playing», «win» and «lose». The game starts in an idle state, changing as the player progresses. The Game class also simplifies tracking the current score and handles key processes such as tile movement and merging. This approach not only enhances maintainability but also makes it easy to extend the game with new features.
